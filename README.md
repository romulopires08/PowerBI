# PowerBI
Our research group has recently made a fascinating discovery: we have identified various oscillation patterns in a newly discovered reaction through simulation. 
However, this nonlinear behavior is extremely sensitive to initial conditions, making it challenging to analyze. 
To communicate our findings effectively, I decided to create a #powerbi dashboard that could visually showcase these oscillations.

To begin, I imported our database into powerquery and created an index for the different oscillations.

Then, I built a new query that associated this index with the oscillation data.

By connecting these queries and creating a table, I was able to create the dashboard.

This powerful tool allows me to select different patterns and display the corresponding oscillations alongside the initial conditions. 
Overall, this presentation method has significantly improved our ability to convey the nuances of our research to others.
